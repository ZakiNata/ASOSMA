## Introduction

React is an open-source Javascript library, firstly develop by Facebook and used by a lot of very big companies (like Airbnb, Reddit, SalesForce, Twitter, WhatsApp and of course Facebook and Instagram). React processes only user interfaces in applications. This is the View in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) template.

### Code Organization

Directory | Description

fixtures | Test fixtures

mock | mock objects
packages | packages used in react

### Challenges

There is a Big picture label in the issues that give some directive line to what to develop next :

- [Support Passive Event Listeners](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6436)
- [New Core Algorithm](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6170)
- [Play Nicely with The DOM Event System (because it's legacy anyway)](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4751)
- [Umbrella: Externalize the State Tree (or alternatives)](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4595)
- [Include DevTools as Public API](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4593)
