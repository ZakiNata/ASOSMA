
In this chapter we will overview some aspects of the project including:
 1. Stakeholders analysis
 2. Challenges of the project
 3. Strategies of mainting an open source code base (including tests, CI, standartization etc...)
 And more...
 
Unfortenatly, in the limited time we had - we did not get to contributing actual code to this project, so the main contribution of this work is shedding some light on charity being done using skills developers allready have (no pawn intended...).
