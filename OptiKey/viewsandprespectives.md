# Views and prespectives 

## OptiKey Fork

* [OptiKey Fork](https://github.com/adirel/OptiKey) - this is our fork to the optikey project
* [OptiKey Fork - Modeling documentation folder](https://github.com/adirel/OptiKey/tree/master/docs/Modeling) - we created a new modeling folder into the optikey project in out fork.

## Documentation and general source code structure

* OptiKey project includes a "docs" folder which contains general information like credits, graphic design notes and some of the deployment proccess of this project.
* [OptiKey wiki](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/wiki) - contain a full user guide about the UI, General information, technical support and troubleshooting and installation proccess.
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLkyORh7vKk) - there is an intro video which is very helpfull.
* general source code structure - is a typicaly .Net formation project of WPF architecture. this is a very importent part which called "enums" and its decribe major part of the system code structure.
 general formation appears to be divided into external tools and main source code (divided by two folders) . inside the source code folder we can detect its seperated into three main areas - Main Source, Unit tests and Auto Complete Performance which is another user test cases and automaticly unit testing focus on performance.

## Major/important design analysis using modeling means

One of the most important stages which represent an open source communinity is adding value and system expandad measures.
The following diagram describe the 4 stages wich needed to adding a new local.
* UI element translations
* a word dictionary
* a keyboard layout
* integrate them into OptiKey
